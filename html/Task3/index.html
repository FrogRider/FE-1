          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            <mark>Halloween</mark>, contraction of All Hallows’ Eve, a holiday observed
            on <time datetime="2019-10-31">October 31</time>, the evening before All Saints’ (or All Hallows’)
            Day. The celebration marks the day before the Western Christian
            feast of All Saints and initiates the season of Allhallowtide,
            which lasts three days and concludes with All Souls’ Day. In much
            of Europe and most of North America, observance of <mark>Halloween</mark> is
            largely nonreligious.
          </p>
          <p>
            <mark>Halloween</mark> had its origins in the festival of Samhain among the Celts
            of ancient Britain and Ireland. On the day corresponding to November
            1 on contemporary calendars, the new year was believed to begin.
            That date was considered the beginning of the winter period, the
            date on which the herds were returned from pasture and land tenures
            were renewed. During the Samhain festival the souls of those who had
            died were believed to return to visit their homes, and those who had
            died during the year were believed to journey to the otherworld.
            People set bonfires on hilltops for relighting their hearth fires
            for the winter and to frighten away evil spirits, and they sometimes
            wore masks and other disguises to avoid being recognized by the
            ghosts thought to be present. It was in those ways that beings
            such as witches, hobgoblins, fairies, and demons came to be
            associated with the day. The period was also thought to be
            favourable for divination on matters such as marriage, health,
            and death. When the Romans conquered the Celts in the 1st century
            CE, they added their own festivals of Feralia, commemorating the
            passing of the dead, and of Pomona, the goddess of the harvest.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 7th century CE Pope Boniface IV established All Saints’
            Day, originally on May 13, and in the following century, perhaps
            in an effort to supplant the pagan holiday with a Christian
            observance, it was moved to November 1. The evening before All
            Saints’ Day became a holy, or hallowed, eve and thus <mark>Halloween</mark>.
            By the end of the Middle Ages, the secular and the sacred days
            had merged. The Reformation essentially put an end to the religious
            holiday among Protestants, although in Britain especially <mark>Halloween</mark>
            continued to be celebrated as a secular holiday. Along with other
            festivities, the celebration of <mark>Halloween</mark> was largely forbidden
            among the early American colonists, although in the 1800s there
            developed festivals that marked the harvest and incorporated
            elements of <mark>Halloween</mark>. When large numbers of immigrants, including
            the Irish, went to the United States beginning in the mid 19th
            century, they took their <mark>Halloween</mark> customs with them, and in the
            20th century <mark>Halloween</mark> became one of the principal U.S. holidays,
            particularly among children.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a secular holiday, <mark>Halloween</mark> has come to be associated
             with anumber of activities. One is the practice of pulling usually
            harmless pranks. Celebrants wear masks and costumes for parties
            and for trick-or-treating, thought to have derived from the
            British practice of allowing the poor to beg for food, called
            “soul cakes.” Trick-or-treaters go from house to house with
            the threat that they will pull a trick if they do not receivea treat,
            usually candy. <mark>Halloween</mark> parties often include games
            such as bobbing for apples, perhaps derived from the Roman
            celebration of Pomona. Along with skeletons and black cats,
            the holiday has incorporated scary beings such as ghosts,
            witches, and vampires into the celebration. Another symbol is
            the jack-o’-lantern, a hollowed-out pumpkin, originally a turnip,
            carved into a demonic face and lit with a candle inside. Since
            the mid-20th century the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)
            has attempted to make the collection of money for its programs a
            part of <mark>Halloween</mark>.
