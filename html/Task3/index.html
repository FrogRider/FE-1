          Halloween, contraction of All Hallows’ Eve, a holiday observed
          on October 31, the evening before All Saints’ (or All Hallows’)
          Day. The celebration marks the day before the Western Christian
          feast of All Saints and initiates the season of Allhallowtide,
          which lasts three days and concludes with All Souls’ Day. In much
          of Europe and most of North America, observance of Halloween is
          largely nonreligious.

          Halloween had its origins in the festival of Samhain among the Celts
          of ancient Britain and Ireland. On the day corresponding to November
          1 on contemporary calendars, the new year was believed to begin.
          That date was considered the beginning of the winter period, the
          date on which the herds were returned from pasture and land tenures
          were renewed. During the Samhain festival the souls of those who had
          died were believed to return to visit their homes, and those who had
          died during the year were believed to journey to the otherworld.
          People set bonfires on hilltops for relighting their hearth fires
          for the winter and to frighten away evil spirits, and they sometimes
          wore masks and other disguises to avoid being recognized by the
          ghosts thought to be present. It was in those ways that beings
          such as witches, hobgoblins, fairies, and demons came to be
          associated with the day. The period was also thought to be
          favourable for divination on matters such as marriage, health,
          and death. When the Romans conquered the Celts in the 1st century
          CE, they added their own festivals of Feralia, commemorating the
          passing of the dead, and of Pomona, the goddess of the harvest.
